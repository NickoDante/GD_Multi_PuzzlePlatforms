PUZZLE PLATFORM

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Hosting Servers with server travels
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* We set the Lobby as the Game Map by default when Build (In Project Settings/Maps & Modes)
* On GameInstance class, Join function, we use ClientTravel to sen the Player Controller to a server ! 
* Client Travel is a Player Controller function ! 
* That clientTravel use a TravelType... We put the absolute.
* now, for testing, we are going to test it with two standalone games using Windows PowerShell (it's like CMD command)
* We put : 

& "D:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.25\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe" 
"D:\UE_Projects\GameDev\Multi_01_PuzzlePlatforms\PuzzlePlatform.uproject" 
-game -log

IMPORTANT! We dont put the map, because we set Lobby as the default map to start.

* On this first game, we use the Host console command to host a server.
* On Powershell again, we use the same line code to start another standalone game: 

& "D:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.25\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe" 
"D:\UE_Projects\GameDev\Multi_01_PuzzlePlatforms\PuzzlePlatform.uproject" 
-game -log

IMPORTANT! It's exactly the same as the above.

* On this second game, we use the Join console command putting the IP Address (192.168.1.103 in this case)
* It works !!!!!
